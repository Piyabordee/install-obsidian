## Structure

```markdown
# [Project Name] — Project Hub

> Central operational hub for AI agents working on this codebase.
> For full documentation index, see [[docs/_index]].
> Stable/non-negotiable rules are stored in `./.claude/rules/`.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | [project name] |
| Type | [project type] |
| Stack | [key technologies] |
| Version | [current version] |
| Repo | [repo URL] |

---

## Read First

- `/.claude/rules/*` — Stable rules (security/compliance/always-on)
- [[docs/_index]] — Full documentation map
- [[docs/project/overview]] — Project identity and stack
- [[README]] — User-facing introduction

## Quick Commands

```bash

[command to test]
[command to build]
```

## Working Rules

1. **[Rule 1]** — [why]
2. **[Rule 2]** — [why]
3. **[Rule 3]** — [why]
... (keep to 5-8 rules, repo-specific)

> Put only operational/session rules here.
> Put stable rules in `./.claude/rules/`.

## Doc Workflow

When creating or significantly modifying a feature:

1. **Spec + Plan** — create in the repo's chosen design/planning location (if using that workflow)
2. **Feature doc** — create in `docs/features/` or appropriate category
3. **Design Origin** — link to spec/plan if applicable
4. **Link here** — add entry to Documentation Map below
5. **Link related docs** — add wiki links in Related section

### Where to put docs

| Category | Path | When |
|----------|------|------|
| Feature workflow | `docs/features/` | New user-facing behavior |
| Architecture | `docs/architecture/` | Structural changes |
| Reference | `docs/reference/` | New constants, config options |
| Project | `docs/project/` | Known issues, project changes |

---

## Documentation Map

### Project
- [[docs/project/overview]] — [one-line description]
- [[docs/project/repository-map]] — [one-line description]
... (only include categories that have docs)

### Architecture
- [[docs/architecture/...]] — [one-line description]

### Features
- [[docs/features/...]] — [one-line description]

### Reference
- [[docs/reference/...]] — [one-line description]

## Key Warnings

- **[Warning 1]** — see [[docs/path-to-detail]]
- **[Warning 2]** — see [[docs/path-to-detail]]

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Change implemented with minimal scope
- [ ] Related docs updated
- [ ] Verification commands run for affected stack
  - TypeScript repos: `tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Commit is scoped to one issue/change set
- [ ] `decisions.md` updated for lasting design choices
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated to match current project state

---

## Session Closeout

At the end of each work session:

1. Update `CLAUDE.md` according to the current project state
2. Update `decisions.md` with new stable decisions
3. Re-check Documentation Map and links

## Related Files

- [[README]] — User-facing intro
- [[AGENTS]] — (if preserved during transition)
- `./.claude/rules/` — Stable rules
- [[decisions]] — Design decisions log
```

## Guidelines

- Keep CLAUDE.md under 100 lines
- Every link must point to a real file
- Working Rules must be specific to THIS repo (no generic rules)
- Keep stable/non-negotiable rules outside CLAUDE.md in `./.claude/rules/`
- Key Warnings should point to docs that explain the risk
- Doc Workflow section must exist so AI knows to auto-create docs
- Include and maintain a directory tree to reduce path confusion
- Add/maintain a DoD + Session Closeout section
