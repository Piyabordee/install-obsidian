> Portable Obsidian documentation system installer for AI agents.
> Drop this folder into any repo. AI reads the instructions, analyzes your codebase, and builds a documentation brain automatically.

## What This Does

This is **not** a traditional installer. It is a set of Markdown instructions that AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) read to:

1. **Analyze** your repo structure
2. **Design** a documentation tree tailored to your codebase
3. **Create** interconnected Markdown docs optimized for Obsidian graph view
4. **Optimize** link structure to remove duplicate/valueless links for cleaner graph + lower token use

The result: your repo gains a living knowledge base that both humans and AI can navigate.

## Hybrid Strategy (Core + Inspired Layer)

This project uses a **hybrid** approach:

- **Core (install-obsidian, non-negotiable):** phase-based installer flow, stable rules, migration safety, and practical completion gates
- **Inspired layer (llm-wiki style):** smaller knowledge units, high-signal cross-links, living docs, and rationale-first writing

The inspired layer is an enhancement, not a replacement for the installer core.

## How to Use

### Option A: With Claude Code

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Piyabordee/install-obsidian.git

# 2. Copy this folder into your repo root
# macOS / Linux:
cp -r install-obsidian/ /path/to/your-repo/

# Windows (PowerShell):
Copy-Item -Recurse install-obsidian\ C:\path\to\your-repo\

# 3. Open Claude Code in your repo
cd /path/to/your-repo
claude

# 4. Tell Claude:
> Read install-obsidian/INSTALL.md and follow the instructions
```

### Option B: With any AI agent

Open `INSTALL.md` and follow the phases. Feed each phase file to your AI agent sequentially.
Before Phase 2, explicitly choose mode: `strict` (default) or `adaptive`.

## What You Get

This installer supports two output modes.

### Core outputs in both modes

- `CLAUDE.md` as the project operational hub
- `docs/_index.md` as the documentation navigation hub
- `./.claude/rules/stable-rules.md` and `./.claude/rules/security-rules.md` for stable/non-negotiable constraints
- `decisions.md` for persistent design decisions across sessions

### Strict mode (default)

Creates a full standardized documentation skeleton:

```
your-repo/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Project hub (AI reads this first)
├── docs/
│   ├── _index.md          # Documentation navigation hub
│   ├── project/           # Project-level knowledge
│   ├── architecture/      # Structure and subsystem docs
│   ├── features/          # Feature workflow docs
│   ├── integrations/      # External dependency docs (if applicable)
│   ├── build/             # Build/packaging docs (if applicable)
│   ├── testing/           # Testing knowledge
│   └── reference/         # Stable reference docs
```

### Adaptive mode

Creates only categories justified by repo analysis (example):

```
your-repo/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── docs/
│   ├── _index.md
│   ├── project/
│   ├── architecture/
│   └── features/
```

In both modes, files must contain real content. No empty placeholders.

## Philosophy

- **Flex, not static** — AI analyzes YOUR repo, creates docs that match YOUR structure
- **Hub-and-spoke** — CLAUDE.md is the front door, docs/ are the rooms
- **Graph-friendly** — Wiki links between docs make Obsidian graph useful
- **Minimal** — Only creates docs where real knowledge exists, no empty placeholders
- **Context-first** — explain why decisions and workflows exist, not only where files are

## Folder Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [[INSTALL]] | Step-by-step instructions for AI agents |
| [[PRINCIPLES]] | Design principles and decision framework |
| [[CONTRIBUTING]] | Contributor guidelines |
| [[CHANGELOG]] | Version tracking |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Operational hub used by AI agents |
| `decisions.md` | Persistent design decision log |
| `.claude/rules/` | Stable project and security rules |
| `TEMPLATES/` | Document structure templates, including migration mapping |
| `PHASES/` | Sequential execution phases (Analyze → Design → Implement → Cleanup → Optimize Links) |

## After Installation

1. Open your repo in Obsidian
2. Enable "Detect all file types" in Obsidian settings
3. Ensure "Use [[Wikilinks]]" is enabled in Settings > Files & Links
4. The graph view should now show meaningful connections between docs
5. When you add new features, AI will follow the Doc Workflow in CLAUDE.md to create new docs automatically

## Requirements

- An AI agent capable of reading files and exploring a codebase
- The target repo must have identifiable structure (any language, any framework)
- Obsidian (optional, for graph view)
